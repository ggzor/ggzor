# Hi!

Here is where the magic happens. ðŸª„

I am a passionate software-developer/computer-scientist who loves to do a bunch
of stuff.

## Relevant stuff

- [Paper](https://github.com/ggzor/specifying-verifying-tail-recursion) about
  formal verification of tail-recursive algorithms using dependent type theory
  submitted to the [LANMR 2022 Workshop](http://www.lanmr.unam.mx/).
- TypeScript and Rust type-level lambda calculus
  [implementations](https://github.com/ggzor/type-level-magic).
- [A support tool](https://github.com/ggzor/turing-machines) for professors
  teaching computability theory with turing machines. It is a graphic
  interpreter for turing machines and a compiler for a
  [subleq-like](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer)
  language, that is compiled to turing machines.
- [A 3D image cluster visualizer](https://github.com/ggzor/md-visualizacion-proyecto-final)
  using React.js. The dataset was tagged using a
  [custom Python tkinter application](https://github.com/ggzor/tk-tagger).
- [A React.js Hanoi's tower interactive visualizer](https://github.com/ggzor/fast-hanoi).
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/ggzor/dotfiles) for Arch Linux, neovim,
  awesomewm, rofi and a lot of other software I use on a daily basis.
- A [Python port](https://github.com/ggzor/plox) of the interpreter for the lox
  language seen in the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).
- [A Pratt-parser implementation](https://github.com/ggzor/pratt-parsing-tests)
  for parser combinators using Haskell.
- [Tcl/Tk mini-chat application](https://github.com/ggzor/Redes).
  I went wild with this project and implemented a custom MVVM framework.
- [Eight-queens solution](https://github.com/ggzor/EightQueens) using Prolog and DLV.
- [Simple web applications using PHP.](https://github.com/ggzor/appweb)
- [Image Processing algorithms in Java.](https://github.com/ggzor/pdi-tareas)
